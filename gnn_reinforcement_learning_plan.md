## 1. Overall Architecture

    A[Game State] --> B[Graph Representation]
    B --> C[PyTorch Geometric Data]
    C --> D[GNN Encoder]
    D --> E[Policy Head]
    D --> F[Value Head]
    E --> G[Move Probabilities]
    F --> H[Position Evaluation]
    G --> I[MCTS]
    H --> I
    I --> J[Selected Move]
    J --> K[Game Environment]
    K --> A
```

### Key Components:

1. **GNN Encoder**: Processes the graph representation of the game state
2. **Policy Head**: Outputs move probabilities
3. **Value Head**: Evaluates the current position
4. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Uses policy and value predictions to plan moves
5. **Training Pipeline**: Manages self-play, data collection, and model updates

## 2. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Supervised Learning

#### 1.1 Model Architecture Design
- Design a GNN architecture that builds on your existing graph representation
- Create policy and value heads that connect to the GNN encoder
- Implement a prediction interface that returns move probabilities and position evaluation

    C --> D[Shared Representation]
    D --> E[Policy MLP]
    D --> F[Value MLP]
    E --> G[Move Probabilities]
    F --> H[Position Value]
```

#### 1.2 Data Generation from Rule-Based AI
- Create a data collection pipeline that records games played by your rule-based AIs
- Store game states, moves chosen, and game outcomes
- Implement data augmentation techniques (e.g., board rotations/reflections if applicable)

#### 1.3 Supervised Learning
- Train the policy network to predict moves made by the rule-based AI
- Train the value network to predict game outcomes
- Implement validation to measure prediction accuracy

### Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning Setup

#### 2.1 MCTS Implementation
- Implement Monte Carlo Tree Search that uses the neural network for guidance
- Create a configurable search process with adjustable parameters (search depth, exploration factor)
- Integrate with the game engine for move selection

#### 2.2 Self-Play Framework
- Develop a self-play system where the AI plays against itself
- Create a game buffer to store self-play games for training
- Implement parallel game generation if resources allow

#### 2.3 Initial RL Training Loop
- Create the reinforcement learning training loop
- Implement policy iteration (self-play → training → evaluation)
- Start with a small scale to validate the approach

### Phase 3: Advanced Training and Optimization

#### 3.1 Curriculum Learning
- Start with simplified game scenarios or against weaker opponents
- Gradually increase difficulty as the model improves
- Implement a rating system to track progress

#### 3.2 Optimization Techniques
- Add experience replay with prioritization
- Implement regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
- Add temperature sampling for move selection during self-play

#### 3.3 Performance Evaluation
- Create an evaluation framework to measure progress
- Compare against rule-based AIs and previous versions
- Track metrics like win rate, game length, and decision quality

### Phase 4: Scaling and Refinement

#### 4.1 Model Scaling
- Increase model size and complexity as resources allow
- Experiment with different GNN architectures
- Optimize for inference speed to allow deeper search

#### 4.2 Advanced Search Techniques
- Implement enhancements to MCTS (e.g., policy-guided playouts)
- Add opening book generation from self-play games
- Explore endgame tablebases if feasible

#### 4.3 Competitive Play
- Test against human players or other Hive AIs
- Analyze weaknesses and implement targeted improvements
- Consider specialized training for different game phases

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.1 GNN Architecture

The GNN architecture will build on your existing graph representation:

- **Node Features**: Piece type, affiliation, stack height, legal moves
- **Edge Types**: Adjacent, above, below, move, retro-move
- **Model Structure**: Multiple GNN layers followed by policy and value heads

```

## 4. Transition Strategy from Rule-Based to Self-Play

### 4.1 Initial Guidance
- Start with supervised learning from rule-based AI games
- Use rule-based evaluation as a regularization term during early RL training
- Implement a hybrid evaluation that combines neural network and rule-based scores

### 4.2 Progressive Transition
- Gradually reduce the influence of rule-based evaluation
- Increase the weight of self-play generated data
- Monitor performance to ensure continuous improvement

### 4.3 Full Self-Play
- Eventually rely entirely on self-play for training data
- Keep rule-based AIs as evaluation benchmarks
- Maintain a population of models at different strengths for training diversity

## 5. Evaluation and Benchmarking

### 5.1 Metrics
- Win rate against rule-based AIs

- Decision quality metrics (agreement with optimal moves if available)
- Learning curve analysis

### 5.2 Visualization and Analysis

- Position evaluation accuracy
- Policy prediction accuracy
- Learning progress dashboards

## 6. Technical Considerations and Challenges

### 6.1 Graph Representation Enhancements

- Experiment with different edge types and features
- Optimize the graph creation process for training speed

### 6.2 Training Efficiency
- Implement batch processing of games
- Consider distributed training for larger models
- Use mixed precision training to reduce memory requirements

### 6.3 Exploration vs. Exploitation
